Graduate Research
-----------------

I am a Graduate Research student at Argonne National Laboratory, in the Nuclear
Science and Engineering Division. I work on energy economic and financial 
modeling, to assess prospects for future private-sector investment in 
nuclear energy. My current research focuses on higher-fidelity agent-based
modeling approaches for capacity investment decisions by electric power 
utilities, and assessing how cost and risk parameters of potential future
nuclear energy projects affect project viability.

I am using and expanding the Argonne A-LEAF code, which is an
optimization-based modeling framework for power system unit commitment, 
economic dispatch, and capacity expansion.

Research Interests and Projects
-------------------------------

 * Agent-based modeling of complex, dynamic economic systems
 * Portfolio optimization with real options valuation for infrastructure

Education
----------

 * University of Wisconsin - Madison (Madison, WI) [PhD Nuclear Engineering & Engineering Physics, current]
 * Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA) [B.S. in Nuclear Science and Engineering, 2015]
